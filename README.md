# NPC_Generator
A Python app that generates quick NPCs for tabletop RPGs

# Overview
I run a number of tabletop RPGs for a variety of groups, and one of the hardest parts for me is coming up with distinct personalities for non-player characters on the spot. So, I decided to write myself an application that could automatically generate NPCs, at least in the broad strokes, on my behalf.

While I could opt to design this application to be fully digital, I don't particularly care for having a laptop with me at the table, in favor of purely non-digital tools. For this purpose, the application is designed to produce .csv files compatible with [CardMaker](https://github.com/nhmkdev/cardmaker), a neat application that can read in csv data to quickly develop sheets of printable cards. With this, I can programatically populate a card sheet with NPC details, then print out a deck for physical use at the table.
