# NPC_Generator
A Python app that generates quick NPCs for tabletop RPGs

# Overview
I run a number of tabletop RPGs for a variety of groups, and one of the hardest parts for me is coming up with distinct personalities for non-player characters on the spot. So, I decided to write myself an application that could automatically generate NPCs, at least in the broad strokes, on my behalf.

While I could opt to design this application to be fully digital, I don't particularly care for having a laptop with me at the table, in favor of purely non-digital tools. For this purpose, the application is designed to produce .csv files compatible with [CardMaker](https://github.com/nhmkdev/cardmaker), a neat application that can read in csv data to quickly develop sheets of printable cards. With this, I can programatically populate a card sheet with NPC details, then print out a deck for physical use at the table.

# How It Works
Characters generated by this application have three primary components. The first is a name, randomly selected from a list generated by hitting the random name API provided by [http://uinames.com](http://uinames.com). These names are originally given in their native alphabet, so python's unidecode function is used to convert them to printable English, a method that still produces some occasional bugs but is generally successful.

Characters also have a set of three personality traits randomly assigned to them. These are pulled from a list of character traits randomly, such that no trait is shared between characters.

The last aspect of a character are approximate statistical attributes. Most RPGs use some sort of numerical system to represent characters' attributes, but using any of those systems in this application would limit its usefulness. Instead, the user may enter the set of attributes they want to use, or use the default D&D stats. Then, the application will go through every attribute for every character, and decide if the character is, in that stat, pathetically inept, lower than average, average, better than average, or exceptional. The numbers are weighted such that average score are more likely than non-average scores.

Then, this list of characters is returned to the user, with a chance to review them and regenerate them before submission. Upon submission, the characters are exported as a CSV, ready to be used by CardMaker to generate a quick-reference deck of NPCs.
